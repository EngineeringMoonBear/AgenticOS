/**
 * Mirror reconcile sweep (scheduled job `mirror-reconcile`).
 *
 * The outbound mirror is purely event-driven: an issue only gets a GitHub twin
 * if its `issue.created` event was delivered AND the handler survived (no
 * scope-expiry, no http.fetch timeout, bridge already configured). Issues
 * created BEFORE a bridge was applied, or during a drop window, are never
 * revisited — ~78 active issues across the three bridged projects had no twin
 * when this shipped. This sweep is the missing feedback loop: every run lists
 * the bridged projects' issues and mirrors any active, unmapped, non-operational
 * issue through the same handleIssueCreated path the event uses (idempotent —
 * it re-checks the mapping and honours the inbound `synced-from-github` marker,
 * so GitHub-originated issues get a provenance row, not a bounce-back).
 *
 * Guard rails:
 *  - `maxCreates` per run (default 20) so a first run over a large backlog
 *    trickles out instead of bursting GitHub rate limits / notification spam.
 *  - Terminal issues (done/cancelled) are skipped — history stays in Paperclip;
 *    mirroring closed work would only create pre-closed GitHub noise.
 *  - Plugin-operational issues (pr-review/ci-fix markers) are skipped, matching
 *    the event-path guard in handleIssueCreated.
 *  - Per-issue failures are counted and logged, never thrown — one bad issue
 *    can't kill the sweep.

 * see 100 issues per project — and on a mature project those are dominated by
 * closed work (the 2026-08-05 run scanned 300 rows, 273 of them terminal, and
 * therefore never reached the 36 issues actually missing a twin). Per-status
 * queries give the backlog its own window each.
 *
 * If a new status is added host-side and not listed here, the sweep silently
 * stops covering it — the trade for reach. `isTerminalStatus` still guards each
 * row, so the failure mode is under-coverage (a missing twin, which the next
 * status addition fixes) rather than mirroring closed work.
